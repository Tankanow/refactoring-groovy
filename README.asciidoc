.Preamble
Hi everybody.  Hi Doctor Nick!  I started this project because I recently started reading Martin Fowler's http://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1359169163&sr=8-1&keywords=refactoring+improving [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code].  It's funny.  I know I'm 12 years late on this book; but, I still see code in production today that doesn't meet a lot of Martin's advice.

.Goal
A developer I admire recently posted on Twitter that he felt the best way to learn a programming language or concepts was to code, code and code.  My goal in this project is to internalize the catalog of refactoring patterns in Fowler's book while learning a language (http://groovy.codehaus.org [Groovy]), a build tool (http://www.gradle.org/ [Gradle]) and a testing framework (https://code.google.com/p/spock/ [Spock]).
